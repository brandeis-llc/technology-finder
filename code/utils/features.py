Features used for FUSE (theones with check marks havebeen implemented):

✓ sentence_loc   the token offsets in the sentence
  section_loc    the location in section
✓ prev_n3        previous three nominals
✓ next_n3        next three nominals
✓ prev_n2        previous two nominals
✓ next_n2        next two nominals
  next2_tags     next two tags
✓ first_word     first word of the candidate term
✓ last_word      last word of the candidate term
✓ plen           length of the candidate term
✓ tag_list       tag signature of the candidate term
✓  prev_V         previous verb
  prev_VNP       previous verb with object: *[increase the speed] of the [computer]*
  prev_Npr       first noun_prep to the left of chunk, within 4 words
  prev_Jpr       first adj_prep to the left of chunk, within 4 words
✓  prev_J         adjective immediately before the candidate term
✓  suffix3        last three characters of the term
✓  suffix4        last four characters of the term
✓  suffix5        last five characters of the term


Notes:

- section_loc: not done because we have no document structure yet

- prev_V: we use the governor of the term instead

- prev_VNP: requires following back the dobj->prep->pobj dependencies

- prev_Npr: things like overview of, aspects of. differences between, approach
  to, analyis of, combination of, etcetera; probably following back prep->pobj
  dependencies

- prev_Jpr: things like such that, equivalent to, applicable to, followed by,
  more than, due to, different from, suitable for, equal to, dependent on,
  useful for, etcetera; probably following back prep->pobj dependencies
