STATES	molecules	light	coherent	light
RELS	illuminated	collected
By this method, molecules residing in the common focal area of both objectives can be illuminated coherently from both sides and the reflected or emitted light can be collected coherently, i.e. coherent superposition of emitted light on the detector is possible.

TERMS	laser light	beam splitter BS	mirrors	objective lenses
STATES	light
RELS	divided
The laser light is divided by a beam splitter BS and directed by mirrors towards the two opposing objective lenses.

TERMS	Excited molecules	position	fluorescence light	objective lenses	same beam splitter	dichroic mirror DM	detector
STATES	molecules	fluorescence	light
RELS	collected	deflected
Excited molecules at this position emit fluorescence light, which is collected by both objective lenses, combined by the same beam splitter and deflected by a dichroic mirror DM onto a detector.

TERMS	type C mode	excitation	emission	light	highest possible resolution increase	optical axis	confocal microscopy
STATES	emission	light	optical
RELS	operated
When operated in the type C mode, both excitation and emission light are allowed to interfere, leading to the highest possible resolution increase ~fold along the optical axis as compared to confocal microscopy.
