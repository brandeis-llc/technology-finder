STATES	acceleration	acceleration	space
RELS	accelerate
The effects of this acceleration are indistinguishable from any other acceleration experienced by the instrument, so that an accelerometer cannot detect the difference between sitting in a rocket on the launch pad, and being in the same rocket in deep space while it uses its engines to accelerate at  g. For similar reasons, an accelerometer will read zero during any type of free fall .

STATES	air	resistance	forces	acceleration
RELS	produces	reduce
However this does not include a nonfree fall in which air resistance produces drag forces that reduce the acceleration, until constant terminal velocity is reached.

STATES	acceleration	mass	mass
RELS	accelerate
When the accelerometer experiences an acceleration, the mass is displaced to the point that the spring is able to accelerate the mass at the same rate as the casing.
