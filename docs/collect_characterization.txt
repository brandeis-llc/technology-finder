Characterizations of the context of terms, states and relations
================================================================================

Description of the output of ../code/collect_characterization.py

That script takes the output of ../code/collect_relations.py and create files
that list relations, terms and states and show their contexts following short
dependency chains. The input is described in collect_relations.txt in this
directory.

It creates the following files:

  out-context-rel2state-az.txt
  out-context-rel2state-nr.txt
  out-context-rel2term-az.txt
  out-context-rel2term-nr.txt
  out-context-state2rel-az.txt
  out-context-state2rel-nr.txt
  out-context-state2term-az.txt
  out-context-state2term-nr.txt
  out-context-term2rel-az.txt
  out-context-term2rel-nr.txt
  out-context-term2state-az.txt
  out-context-term2state-nr.txt

The files contain a header and tab-separated lines, but with extra spaces added
for readability. In addition, there are 12 pure tab-separated files that are
harder to read but easier to process or put in a spreadsheet.

Each line has three columns:

	1- frequency of the focus element
	2- focus element
	3- context of the focus element

The name of the file tells you what the content is. For example, the third part
of the name of the first file above is "rel2state", which indicates that the
file lists each relation (that is, the focus element is a relation) with all the
states that it occurs in a pair with (that is, the context of the focus elements
is a list of states).

Here are a few lines from out-context-state2term-nr.txt:

  4860  light   visible laser infrared image ultraviolet beam speed incident polarized surface
  4839  energy  thermal electrical kinetic high higher electrons photon lower electron enough
  4300  field   magnetic electric coil electrons electromagnetic view current electrical ions light
  3589  power   nuclear electric electrical solar high reactive microwave electricity low optical

The third column is ordered on frequency, so "visible" occurs with "light" more
often than "laser" does.
