Pairs of terms, states and relations
================================================================================

The file created by collect_relations.py, called out-relations.txt unless it was
renamed, contains a list of whiteline-separated paragraphs. Each paragraph has
a sentence for which at least one pair could be found and for each sentence we
have the following lines:

- One line, starting with FNAME, that contains the file name where the sentence
  occurs.

  FNAME	/DATA/ttap/processed/SensorData/4Pi_microscope.lif.gz

- A set of lines starting with one of REL-TRM, REL-STA and TRM-STA, one for each
  pair found. The prefix is followed by four things: (1) the token identifiers
  of the head of each element of the pair, (2) the first element of the pair,
  (3) the second element of the pair, and (4) the dependency chain between the
  two elements. Only pairs with short dependency chains were added.

  REL-TRM t26-t19	improved	typical value	improved --nsubjpass--> value

- One line with the tokenized sentence, with parts of speech.

- A set of lines each starting with DEP, reflecting the full dependency parse.

- One line with the actual sentence.

The full set has about 33K sentences with pairs.
