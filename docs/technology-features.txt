A. GENERAL TECHNOLOGY FEATURES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Position

- Location of the in the document
- Distribution of the term in the document
- Location in the section
- Location in the sentence


2. Frequencies

- Number of occurrences of the term in the document
- Maturity score
	(not a document level feature, maybe not include here)


3. Internal Features

- first_word: first word of the term
- last_word: last word in the term
- term_length: number of tokens in the term
- tag_signature: tags of the tokens in the term
- number of characters in term
- suffix and prefix


4. External features (1) - simple context

- prev_n3: previous three nouns
- prev_n2: previous two nouns
- next_n3: next three nouns
- next_n2: next two nouns
- prev_V: previous verb
- prev_VNP: previous verb with object: *[increase the speed] of the [computer]*
- prev_Npr: first noun_prep to the left of the term, within 4 words
- prev_Jpr: first adj_prep to the left of chunk, within 4 words
- prev_J: adjective immediately before the candidate term


5. External features (2) - phrase structure and dependencies

- predicate of the term
- phrase type
- parse tree path from term to predicate
- parse tree path to the top
- voice of the phrase (active versus passive)
- relative position relative to the predicate (before or after)
- subcategorization of the predicate
- dependency path to the root
- dependency path to the predicate


6. Semantic features

- predicate type (verbnet class)
- wordnet synsets of surrounding nominal
	need to take some set of synsets for this



B. Features specifically formulated for the subject technologies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: these can often be seen as specific instances of the features above


Position

– title, abstract, early in documents


Frequencies

- Number of occurrences of the term in the document
	frequency is high in the document, low frequency in other documents
	low maturity score

- Maturity score



Modifiers - Clause

- Differentiation/contrast
- For example, use of "traditional"


Modifiers - Adjective

- Surrounded by positive attributes

	novel, improved, new, faster, more (secure,efficient)
	low-cost, scalable, unique, recently (published), rapid
	experimental

	Measure this by extracting adjectives within a certain window 
	and compare them to a list of positive attributes
	Or by running the ACT code

- Positive terms a couple of sentences later

	advance, improvement, pave the way, toward, great potential


Modifiers - Prepositional phrase

- Telic and formal role are spelled out.
- See document sent out by James
- Modifying clause “for”, “based on”, “consists of”


Characteristics of names

- More characters than average technical term
- Derivational morphology, e.g. –scopy, -meter,
- Inflectional morphology, e.g. "ing"
	Can be used in nominalized, sortal, or agentive function


Substrings of technical term come back later on

- they are qualifications and/or further specify the technology
- similarly, the term can come back in expanded form, again indicating further qualifications


Trigger verbs in left context

- e.g. “device”, “create”, “develop”


Specializations of tech in adjectival modifications


Function of technical term

- Keyterm classifier classifies term as a task rather than a component


Low maturity score


Higher likelihood to have spelled out acronym
